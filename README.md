# Airflow_Code

# Project overview

Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) is AWS’s managed service that lets you run Apache Airflow without worrying about infrastructure setup, scaling, or security. It provides a fully managed environment to orchestrate workflows using Python and Airflow DAGs, tightly integrated with AWS services.


## Features

- Definition: Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow.

- Purpose: Simplifies running data pipelines in the cloud by removing the need to manage servers, scaling, or patching.

- Core Idea: You write DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Python, and MWAA executes them reliably at scale.
